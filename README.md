# RestaurantRater
This aplication represents a restaurant rating website. 

The website allows the user to search amongst available restaurants, view their details and even add ratings and reviews themselves. 
Each restaurant posesses a description, representative images, star rating and reviews. Additionally, the user can find a restaurant address 
and explore its location visually on a map implmented via the Google Maps API.

The website implements authentification and restricts a number of actions exclusively to logged in users.
Upon sign up a user profile is created that can include the users name, address, reviews and favorite restaurants.
Additionally, a sign in user has the option to add restaurants(and thus become owners) and these restaurants will be displayed under a specific 
list on their own profile page.
The authentification system implements a number of checks upon user sign up invluding password validation and address validation.
Among the log in restricted functionalities are the favorite page, the rate and add review options, as well as the sort restaurants by
distance to home option.
However, even unsigned in users can access the home page, the basic explore page and its sort alphabetically and sort by rating functions.
Additionally,each restaurant page can be viewed in its entirety by all users.
Finally,a user can chose to delete their profile and their personal data as well as their contribution to the website get removed.
